# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - [Initialization] **Learning:** Initialized Bolt's journal. **Action:** Record critical performance learnings here.

## 2025-12-18 - [JSON Unmarshalling] **Learning:** Polymorphic JSON messages (flat structure) often lead to double parsing (once for type, once for content). **Action:** Use a "Unified" struct containing all possible fields to allow single-pass unmarshalling when fields do not collide.

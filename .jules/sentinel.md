## 2025-12-18 - Cron Shell Injection via Unquoted Command Strings
**Risk:** The previous fix for injection used `shellQuote` but did not apply it to the `Command` payload itself, and the `Command` was not wrapped in an explicit shell invocation. This allowed metacharacters in the `Command` string to be interpreted by the cron shell, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands outside the intended execution scope.
**Learning:** When passing a "command string" through an intermediate shell (like cron) to an execution wrapper, the safest pattern is to quote the command string and pass it as an argument to `sh -c`. This ensures the cron shell sees it as a single argument, and the inner shell executes it as intended, isolating the execution environments.
**Action:** Wrap cron commands in `/bin/sh -c '<quoted_command>'` and ensure all other arguments (like JobID) are strictly shell-quoted.
